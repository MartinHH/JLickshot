For the main output, it features a simple delay unit and a reverb unit based on [MVerb by Martin Eastwood](https://github.com/martineastwood/mverb).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4129902/4201150/d7d62d96-381a-11e4-8d58-950f68480936.png\" width=100% height=100%> \r\n\r\nSamples are triggered via MIDI. Each sample is assigned to one note. Since the main use case for this software is triggering short samples during DJ performances, the velocity value recieved via MIDI is ignored and replaced by a fixed value (which can be set for each sample as an invidiual gain per sample).\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer: Don't expect too much\r\n\r\nThis software was designed in very short time to suit personal needs - don't expect it to be anything else but a tiny (free) tool for a very specific use case.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
